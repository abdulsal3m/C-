Once
there
was
a
tree
and
she
loved
a
little
boy
And
everyday
the
boy
would
come
and
he
would
gather
her
leaves
and
make
them
into
crowns
and
play
king
of
the
forest
He
would
climb
up
her
trunk
and
swing
from
her
branches
and
eat
apples
And
they
would
play
hide-and-go-seek
And
when
he
was
tired
he
would
sleep
in
her
shade
And
the
boy
loved
the
tree
very
much
And
the
tree
was
happy
